====== God the Father, heavenly Father, Father ======

===== Facts: =====

The terms, "God the Father" and "heavenly Father" refer to Yahweh, the one true God. This term also occurs as "Father," especially when Jesus is referring to him.

  * God exists as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Each one is fully God, and yet they are only one God. This is a mystery that mere humans cannot fully understand.
  * God the Father sent God the Son (Jesus) into the world and he sends the Holy Spirit to his people.
  * Anyone who believes in God the Son becomes a child of God the Father, and God the Holy Spirit comes to live in that person. This is another mystery that human beings cannot fully understand.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In the phrase "God the Father," it is best to translate "Father" with the same word that the language naturally uses to refer to a human father.
  * The term "heavenly Father" could be translated by "Father who lives in heaven" or "Father God who lives in heaven" or "God our Father from heaven."
  * Usually "Father" is capitalized, to show that this refers to God.
