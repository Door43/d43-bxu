===== Facts: =====

The Old Testament term "Arabah" often refers to a very large desert and plains region that includes the valley surrounding the Jordan River and extends south to the northern tip of the Red Sea.

  * The Israelites traveled through this desert region on their journey from Egypt to the land of Canaan.
