====== Jehoram, Joram ======

===== Facts: =====

Jehoram was the name of two different kings in the Old Testament. Both these kings were also known as "Joram."

  * One King Jehoram ruled over the kingdom of Judah for eight years. He was the son of King Jehoshaphat. This is the king that is most commonly known as Jehoram.
  * The other King Jehoram ruled over the kingdom of Israel for twelve years. He was the son of King Ahab.
  * King Jehoram of Judah reigned during the time that the prophets Jeremiah, Daniel, Obadiah, and Ezekiel were prophesying in the kingdom of Judah.
  * Jehoram also reigned during some of the time that his father King Jehoshaphat was reigning over Judah.
  * Some translations may choose to consistently use the name "Jehoram" when this king of Israel is mentioned and the name "Joram" for the king of Judah.
  * Another way to clearly identify each one would be to include the name of his father.
