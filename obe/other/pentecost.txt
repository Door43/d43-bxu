  * The name "Festival of Weeks" came from the fact that this festival marked the completion of seven weeks of harvest which began at the Feast of Firstfruits, around the time of the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
  * The Festival of Weeks was held to celebrate the end of the wheat grain harvest. It was also known as the "Festival of Harvest."
