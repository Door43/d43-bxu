====== storehouse ======

===== Definition: =====

A "storehouse" is a large building that is used for keeping food or other things, often for a long time.

  * In the Bible a "storehouse" was usually used to store extra grain and other food to be used later when there was a shortage of food because of famine.
  * This term is also used figuratively to refer to all the good things that God wants to give to his people.
  * The storehouses of the temple contained valuable things, such as gold and silver, that had been dedicated to Yahweh. Some of these things were used to repair and maintain the temple.
  * Other ways to translate "storehouse" could include, "a building for storing grain" or "place for keeping food" or "room for keeping valuable things safe."
